Cookiecutter-datascience
========================

Cookiecutter template for datascience.

Usage
-----
To start a new project from this cookiecutter, install [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) _(duh)_ and then do;

```bash
cookiecutter gh:eliavw/cookiecutter-datascience
``` 

Future work
-----------

This is still a work in progress and will likely never be finished. However, always a bit better! Some ideas for new, extra features are;

- Describe to generate API docs from docstrings.
- Unittest documentation and code style (black).
- Automatic test generation from notebooks
- CI on Github
- GIT Hooks.
