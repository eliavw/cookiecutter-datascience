<<<<<<< HEAD
Future work
-----------

This is still a work in progress and will likely never be finished. However, always a bit better! Some ideas for new, extra features are;

- Describe to generate API docs from docstrings.
- Unittest documentation and code style (black).
=======
Todo
-----

This will always be a work in progress. Current workflows that are potentially interesting to add:

- Versioning and releases of pip packages
- Easy conversion of notebooks to webpages for the doc site.
- Generation of API-docs from docstrings
