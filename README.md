Cookiecutter-datascience
========================

Cookiecutter template for datascience projects.

Usage
-----
To start a new project from this cookiecutter, install [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) _(obviously...)_ and then do;

```bash
cookiecutter gh:eliavw/cookiecutter-datascience
``` 

Future work
-----------

This is still a work in progress and will likely never be finished. The list below keeps track of possible improvements.


- [ ] Test: CI on github
- [ ] Test: Notebooks as integration tests
- [ ] Dependency Mgmt: Keep ``setup.cfg`` and ``dependencies-deploy.yaml`` consistent automatically.
- [ ] Docs: Auto-generate API docs from docstrings
- [ ] Test: Unittest docs and code style


Side-effect
-----------

_This_ repo is also basically an example of how _you_ can also make your own cookiecutter!
