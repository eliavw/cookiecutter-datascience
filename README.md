Cookiecutter-datascience
========================

Cookiecutter template for datascience.

Usage
-----
To start a new project from this cookiecutter, install cookiecutter (duh) and then do;

``` 


Future work
-----------

This is still a work in progress and will likely never be finished. However, always a bit better! Some ideas for new, extra features are;

- Describe to generate API docs from docstrings.
- Unittest documentation and code style (black).
